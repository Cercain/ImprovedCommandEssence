## Why?

The Command Artifact is too strong, but having better control over your build is fun.

This mod gives you more control over your run while not being imba

A similar mod exists but does not have the configurability or additional QOL this does

## What it do?

This mod changes the amount of options that you can choose from the Command Essences that drop with the Command Artifact.

Also provides some QOL options like having the Bazaar and Terminal shops drop the item they are displaying


## Config

Improved Command Essence is highly configurable, you can change the amount of options you can chose from for each tier individually 

### Defaults:
#### You can change the option amount for each tier
| Rarity/Tier             |    Options      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Common (White)   |  6 |
| Uncommon (Green) |  4  |
| Legendary (Red)  |  2 |
| Lunar (Blue)  |  2 |
| Boss (Yellow)  |  2 |
| Equipment (Orange)  |  4 |
| Void (Purple)  |  2 |

(All void tiers use the same config)
(Lunar items and lunar equipment use the same config)

#### Toggle Options
| Name             |    default      | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|------------|
| onInBazaar   |  false | If false item drops in the Bazaar will drop as the actual item not a Command Essence |
| onInDropShip |  false  | If false item drops from terminals (like the Drop Ship) will drop as the actual item not a Command Essence |
