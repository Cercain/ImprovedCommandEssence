## Why?

The Command Artifact is too strong, but having better control over your build is fun.
So this mod gives you more control over your run while not being imba

## Config

You can configure each tier with it's own number of options to show
You can also toggle if Category Chests (Healing, Utility, Damage) only show options of that item category (default on)

Note: All void tiers use the same config
